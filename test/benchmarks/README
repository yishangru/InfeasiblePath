Here are 3 more benchmarks to try running your infeasible path detection on!

infeasible_paths_test.c is my writeup of the example from the paper.
bzip2 is from SPEC2006, so don't distribute that any farther.
LULESH is from https://github.com/LLNL/LULESH , but I ripped the build system out because it was unnecessary ;)


They're all easy to compile as well, as you can see from these example commands:

clang infeasible_paths_test.c -o infeasible_paths_test

cd spec_bzip2_src && clang *.c -o bzip
cd ..

cd LULESH && clang++ -DUSE_MPI=0 *.cc -o lulesh
cd ..



Good luck!
